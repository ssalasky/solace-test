## Future Improvements
- Add sorting to the table to allow users to sort by each column
- Implement filters for city, degree, years of experience and specialties columns
    - This would give a user the ability to search by multiple criteria simultaneously
- Add the ability for a user to "favorite" advocates to create a sort of "short list" of who to reach out to
- Add indexes to the advocates table to improve query speed as dataset grows
